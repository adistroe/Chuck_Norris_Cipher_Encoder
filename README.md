### About
This is the ***Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>What about encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher ... because Chuck Norris encrypts only with zeros.</p>
<p>In this project, you will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this sequence into text.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/16">Android Development with Kotlin</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/37">Kotlin Backend Developer (Spring Boot)</a></li>
</ul>

### Learning outcomes
<p>This project will allow us to deal with string and character variables and work with loops and conditional statements. Get familiar with the binary notation and data type conversion.</p>
<p>Create an application for the unary representation and decoding of any text.</p>
